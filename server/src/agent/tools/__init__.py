"""LangChain Tools for the Revit Chat Agent.

Place small, focused tool modules here. Each tool should be a LangChain
Tool (e.g., via ``@tool``) and optionally expose a factory (e.g., ``get_tools``)
to allow discovery and binding by the agent at runtime. Legacy adapters and
custom chain scaffolding are removed in favor of first-class LangChain APIs.
