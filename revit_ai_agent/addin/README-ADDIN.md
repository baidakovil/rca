# Revit Add-in (pyRevit) â€” POC

This directory contains a pyRevit bundle that will provide a simple chat UI and HTTP scripts to talk to the server.

## Install (Windows 11)

1. Install pyRevit.
2. Copy the `revit_ai.bundle` into your pyRevit extensions folder.
3. Restart Revit, load the extension, and run the scripts from the ribbon.

Notes:
- This is a scaffold only (Prompt 1). The scripts do not yet make HTTP calls.
- Next step (Prompt 2) will implement the actual logic.
